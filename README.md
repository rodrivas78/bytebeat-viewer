 
 Bytebeat Viewer  by  Rodrigo G. (rodrivas78)
 
 This application generate visualizations for "bytebeats" ("one liners"  
 or small programs that produce interesting sound and musical results). When plotted, many of 
them result in fractals. So I thought it appropriate to call them "sound fractals" too. For more 
information on Bytebeats, I recommend the website (link below) of Ville-Matias Heikkil√§em 
(a.k.a. Viznut), the discoverer of this method.
